* Task-1 : Crowd Density Estimator
 About the dataset:
  - The Shanghaitech dataset is a large-scale crowd counting dataset. It consists of 1198 annotated crowd images. The dataset is divided into two parts, Part-A containing 482 images and Part-B containing 716 images. Part-A is split into train and test subsets consisting of 300 and 182 images, respectively. Part-B is split into train and test subsets consisting of 400 and 316 images. 
  - Each person in a crowd image is annotated with one point close to the center of the head. In total, the dataset consists of 330,165 annotated people. Images from Part-A were collected from the Internet, while images from Part-B were collected on the busy streets of Shanghai.



* Task-2 : Human Activity Recognition
 About the dataset:

  -  The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
  -  Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:
    a) WALKING,
    b) WALKING_UPSTAIRS,
    c) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
    d) SITTING,
    e) STANDING,
    f) LAYING
  -  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
